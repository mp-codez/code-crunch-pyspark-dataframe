Subject: Exit Re-Entry Visa Request for Upcoming Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I would like to request your assistance in applying for my Exit Re-Entry Visa. I will be on leave from 17 April to 1 May 2025, with my flight scheduled at 00:35 AM on 17 April 2025.

The customer has already been informed and aligned regarding my absence. For your convenience, Iâ€™ve attached the relevant screenshot(s) for reference.

Looking forward to your support.

Kind regards,
[Your Full Name]

Let me know if you want it more formal or more casual.
