Here’s a clean and structured way to document your pipeline proposal. You can use this for a presentation, email, or project plan.

Focus Build Data Pipeline Proposal


---

1. Objectives

Automate Data Ingestion: Fetch data from Focus Build API every hour.

Store for Auditing & Processing: Save the raw data into HDFS for traceability and batch processing.

Transform & Load: Clean/transform data and load it into a SQL system for business users.

Email Alert System: Automatically send an email if any row contains a status = 'Failed'.

Scalable & Maintainable: Design a reusable and scalable data pipeline using standard big data tools.

2. Architecture & Time Frame

High-Level Architecture

Focus Build API
     |
     v
[API Connector - Python/NiFi]
     |
     v
[Raw Zone - HDFS]
     |
     v
[Transformation - PySpark]
     |
     v
[SQL System - MySQL/PostgreSQL]
     |
     v
[Status Check & Email Notification]

Pipeline Frequency

Runs every hour via Apache Oozie or Airflow, or OS-level cron.


Time Frame

Total Estimated Time: 3–4 weeks

3. Requirements from Other Teams

From API/Focus Build Team

API documentation and authentication mechanism

Access token or credentials

API endpoint details (pagination, filters, etc.)


From Infrastructure/DevOps Team

Access to HDFS write path

Access to SQL system (write permissions, schema)

SMTP server details for sending emails

Scheduling support (Airflow/Oozie/cron permissions)


From Security/Compliance Team

Review of data access and authentication methods

Approval for storage of sensitive data in HDFS and SQL

Encryption/tokenization requirements (if any)


From SQL Team (if separate)

Target table creation or permission to create

Indexing strategy (if needed)

SLA for data availability
