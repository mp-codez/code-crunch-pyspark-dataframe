Here‚Äôs a clean and structured way to document your pipeline proposal. You can use this for a presentation, email, or project plan.

Focus Build Data Pipeline Proposal


---

1. Objectives

Automate Data Ingestion: Fetch data from Focus Build API every hour.

Store for Auditing & Processing: Save the raw data into HDFS for traceability and batch processing.

Transform & Load: Clean/transform data and load it into a SQL system for business users.

Email Alert System: Automatically send an email if any row contains a status = 'Failed'.

Scalable & Maintainable: Design a reusable and scalable data pipeline using standard big data tools.

2. Architecture & Time Frame

High-Level Architecture

Focus Build API
     |
     v
[API Connector - Python/NiFi]
     |
     v
[Raw Zone - HDFS]
     |
     v
[Transformation - PySpark]
     |
     v
[SQL System - MySQL/PostgreSQL]

[Status Check & Email Notification]

Pipeline Frequency

Runs every hour via Apache Oozie or Airflow, or OS-level cron.


Time Frame

Total Estimated Time: 3‚Äì4 weeks

3. Requirements from Other Teams

From API/Focus Build Team

API documentation and authentication mechanism

Access token or credentials

API endpoint details (pagination, filters, etc.)


From Infrastructure/DevOps Team

Access to HDFS write path

Access to SQL system (write permissions, schema)

SMTP server details for sending emails

Scheduling support (Airflow/Oozie/cron permissions)


From Security/Compliance Team

Review of data access and authentication methods

Approval for storage of sensitive data in HDFS and SQL

Encryption/tokenization requirements (if any)


From SQL Team (if separate)

Target table creation or permission to create

Indexing strategy (if needed)

SLA for data availability

‚âà====================

Got it üëç ‚Äî so you want to keep the same document structure,
but add one more clarification:

Even though teams log in via API and get a key (token) for API access,
the developer also needs to save the Ozone secret key (generated using the ozone getsecret command)
inside the same dictionary for internal API-to-Ozone communication.

Here‚Äôs your final, fully updated Developer Support Document üëá

API Integration for Ozone Storage Access

Overview

We have developed an API to store and manage data in Apache Ozone Storage.
This document explains the onboarding process for any new team that wants to use Ozone through this API.


---

1. Onboarding New Team

When a new team needs access to Ozone Storage through the API, follow these steps:

Step 1: Provide Service Account

The new team must share their service account and password with the admin.

This service account will be used for authentication and to generate both API and Ozone-level access keys.


Step 2: API Login and Key Generation

The new team logs in using the API login endpoint, providing their service account credentials.

On successful authentication, the API returns an access key (token).

This key must be used in the header for all subsequent API requests.


Example:

POST /api/login
{
    "service_account": "<team_service_account>",
    "password": "<password>"
}

Response:

{
    "access_key": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5..."
}


---

2. Secret Key Retrieval (for Developer Use)

The developer (admin side) must use the following Ozone command to retrieve the Ozone secret key associated with the team‚Äôs service account:

ozone getsecret --service-account <team_service_account>

The secret key obtained from this command must be saved securely in the API code.
It should be stored inside a dictionary that maps each team to both their API key and Ozone secret key.


Example:

ozone_keys = {
    "team_alpha": {
        "api_key": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5...",
        "ozone_secret_key": "SECRET_KEY_123"
    },
    "team_beta": {
        "api_key": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5...",
        "ozone_secret_key": "SECRET_KEY_456"
    }
}

This ensures that the application can internally authenticate with Ozone for operations such as data storage or retrieval.


---

3. Bucket Creation and Access Policies

Step 1: Bucket Creation

The admin will create the required bucket(s) in Ozone for the new team based on their storage requirements.

ozone sh bucket create /s3v/<team_bucket_name>


Step 2: Ranger Policy Configuration

The admin will configure Apache Ranger policies to define access permissions (read, write, delete, etc.) for the team‚Äôs Ozone bucket.



---

4. Accessing Ozone via API

Once the setup is complete:

Teams can use their API access key to call APIs for data upload, retrieval, and management.

The internal API layer will use the Ozone secret key (stored in the dictionary) to communicate securely with the Ozone storage backend.



---

5. Summary

Task	Responsible	Description

Provide Service Account	Team	To authenticate and generate Ozone access
API Login	Team	Obtain access key for API calls
Retrieve Secret Key	Developer/Admin	Use ozone getsecret command to get Ozone key
Store Keys in Code	Developer	Save both API key and secret key in dictionary
Create Bucket	Admin	For team-specific data storage
Configure Ranger Policy	Admin	Define Ozone access permissions per team
